Simulation Results Summary

The simulation was executed for an 8-hour operating period under a base chatbot adoption scenario of 60%.

Key observations:
- Increased chatbot adoption reduced customer waiting times
- Human agent utilisation decreased as chatbot adoption increased
- System performance remained stable under moderate demand fluctuations

Detailed numerical results are discussed and interpreted in the dissertation.
